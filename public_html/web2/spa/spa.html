        <h1>Why this sparks my interest!</h1>
      <p>It shows that when we pass that there’s something waiting for us and gives some people a sense of hope, as well as all the proof we have all over the internet of people like us being able to speak to those who have passed on and being able to share their stories and their truths. This is something that interests me because it can give some a sense of relief knowing that there’s more than nothing when we pass on… </p>
